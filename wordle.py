"""
Simple implementation of the wordle game

Player inputs a text file for wordle game to pick a 5-letter word.
The game prompts the user for 5 letter guesses.
Bad inputs are ignored and the player is prompted again.
Correctly placed letters are green.
Yellow letters are in the word, but misplaced.
Red letters are not in the word.
Feedback is given if the user guesses the right word or
the word is just given if the user doesn't guess in 6 tries.
